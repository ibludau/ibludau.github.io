  - title: "Decipher molecular heterogeneity across brain tumors"
    excerpt: "**Multi-omics investigation of alternative promoter usage in IDH-mutant glioma**: One of our central interests is to understand how genertic and epi-genetic alteratiions in cancer travers along the axis of gene expression. In this project, led by **Nhu Nguyen** focuses on a multi-omics investigation of the effect of methylation changes in IDH-mutatnt gliomas and their impact on alternative promoter usage and respective protein expression. For this, we integrate methylation data with both short- and long-read RNAseq, ATAC-seq and proteomics data. <br><br> **Systematic detection of brain cancer specific proteoforms**: Most genes are know to give rise to multiple different protein products, also called proteoforms, that differ in their primary amino acid sequence and associated modifications. Although the expression of alternative proteoforms is of immense functional importance, they are challenging to detect in classical proteomics approaches and are frequently neglected. This is particularly critical in the context of cancer. Here, molecular diversity is further expanded by different types of cancer-driven alterations. A central goal of our team is to develop computational strategies for the systematic detection of proteoforms based on AI-powered multi-omics data integration."
  - title: "Investigate molecular heterogeneity within one tumor"
    excerpt: "**Spatial characterisation of glioblastoma cells by integration of snRNA and spatial RNA sequencing data**: To enable a precise characterization of tumor cell heterogeneity in the spatial context, it is essential to confidently identify and distinguish them from non-neoplastic cells. This is not trivial for several glional tumor types without a known tumor-specific RNA expression signature. In this project led by **Dilan Savran**, we integrate snRNA data with spatial RNAseq data from 10X Xenium to transfer cell type confidence, thus enabling the spatial analysis of individual gliome cells. <br><br> **Spatial characterization of brain tumors across multiple omics layers**: While RNA expression can serve as valuable proxy, proteins are the actual functional units in cells. Therefore, investigating their expression in individual cell types across tumor tissue is expected to provide more functionally relevant insights. **Rhaissa** is spearheading this exciting project of developing the technology to characterize brain tumors based on a spatial multi-omics exploration."
