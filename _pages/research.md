  - title: "Decipher molecular heterogeneity across brain tumors"
    excerpt: "Many genes are known to give rise to multiple different protein products, also called proteoforms, that differ in their primary amino acid sequence and associated modifications. These can be derived from molecular diversification on all levels along the axis of gene expression ([Bludau & Aebersold, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-020-0231-2)). Although the expression of alternative proteoforms is of immense functional importance, they are challenging to detect and are frequently neglected. This is particularly critical in the context of cancer. Here, molecular diversity is further expanded by different types of cancer-driven alterations.<br><br><strong>A central goal of our team is to develop computational strategies for the systematic detection of proteoforms based on AI-powered multi-omics data integration.</strong> "
